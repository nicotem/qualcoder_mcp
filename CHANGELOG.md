## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-28

### Added - Core Three Features + Rich Analysis

This release adds the four most-requested features for advanced qualitative data analysis:

#### 1. Rich Transcript Analysis
- **New Tool**: `analyze_file_with_coding(file_id)`
- Retrieve complete file text WITH all coding information overlaid
- Enables deep contextual analysis beyond just coded segments
- Perfect for questions like "What does Paul say about X?" that require full transcript context
- Returns: full text, coded segments, code usage, annotations, and statistics

#### 2. Attributes & Demographics System
- **New Tool**: `list_attribute_types()` - List all available attributes
- **New Tool**: `get_file_attributes(file_id)` - Get attributes for a file
- **New Tool**: `get_case_attributes(case_id)` - Get attributes for a case
- **New Tool**: `query_by_attribute(attr_name, attr_value, attr_type)` - Query by demographics
- Support for both case and file attributes
- Enables queries like "Show me participants over age 50" or "Find focus group interviews"

#### 3. Co-occurrence Analysis
- **New Tool**: `find_cooccurring_codes(code_id, window_size)`
- Discover which codes appear together in the same segments
- Support for exact overlap or proximity-based co-occurrence (window size)
- Essential for pattern discovery and relationship analysis
- Returns frequency counts and percentages

#### 4. Case-Code Matrix & Comparative Analysis
- **New Tool**: `get_case_code_matrix()` - Full cross-tabulation matrix
- **New Tool**: `get_codes_by_case(case_id)` - Codes used in a specific case
- **New Tool**: `get_cases_by_code(code_id)` - Cases containing a specific code
- Enables comparative analysis across participants
- Perfect for questions like "Which participants mentioned theme X?"

### Enhanced

#### Database Layer (database.py)
- Added 450+ lines of new methods with comprehensive validation
- All new methods include error handling and input validation
- Full documentation with examples

#### Server Layer (server.py)
- Added 8 new MCP tools with detailed docstrings
- Each tool includes usage examples and clear parameter descriptions
- Maintains read-only safety guarantees

#### Documentation
- Updated README.md with new feature examples
- Added usage examples for all new features
- Updated contributing section to reflect completed work

### Technical Details

**New Database Methods** (database.py):
- `list_attribute_types()` - Query attribute type definitions
- `get_file_attributes(file_id)` - File attribute values
- `get_case_attributes(case_id)` - Case attribute values
- `query_by_attribute(attr_name, attr_value, attr_type)` - Attribute-based search
- `find_code_cooccurrences(code_id, window_size)` - Co-occurrence detection
- `get_case_code_matrix()` - Matrix generation
- `get_codes_by_case(case_id)` - Per-case code usage
- `get_cases_by_code(code_id)` - Per-code case coverage
- `get_file_with_coding(file_id)` - Rich file analysis

**Lines of Code**: ~500 lines added across database.py and server.py

### Use Cases Enabled

This release enables several critical research workflows:

**Demographic Analysis:**
```
"Show me coding patterns for participants over 50"
"Compare themes by gender"
"Which urban participants discussed remote work?"
```

**Pattern Discovery:**
```
"What themes appear together with workplace stress?"
"Find codes that co-occur with job satisfaction"
"Show me the co-occurrence network"
```

**Comparative Analysis:**
```
"Which participants mentioned work-life balance?"
"Create a table of themes by case"
"Find cases discussing both theme X and theme Y"
```

**Rich Contextual Analysis:**
```
"What does Paul say about Wisdom of the Crowds? Consider both coded segments and the full transcript."
"Analyze how this participant discusses motivation throughout the entire interview"
```
